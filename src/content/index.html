    <h2>Minimize IT failures cost</h2>
    <p>Business must run. Nobody wants their customers to get an <em>"Error 404"</em> from the web server or all employees to get stuck in their work because the <em>"router is overloaded"</em>.</p>
    <blockquote><p>With Sysmo you can proactively detect problems and quickly identify the current ones, increasing your overall IT services reactivity and fiability. You will then enhance employees productivity and customers satisfaction.</p></blockquote>

    <h2>Free your IT team</h2>
    <p>As important as management or monitoring tools are, they must help the IT team to concentrate on business valuable services. Not the opposite.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Our main  top notch Sysmo-Operator user interface offer to your IT team the most efficient and ergonomic tool on the market for monitoring and managing their elements. They can then concentrate on business centred services rather than reading heavy documentations, or doing pointless administration tasks.</p></blockquote>
    <h2>Manage your IT infrastructure</h2>
    <p>To accompany business growth, the IT team needs a professional tool to handle increasing numbers of network elements and servers.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Sysmo introduces some original concepts that will improve overall IT consistency by allowing IT team to inventory and access any kind of network or server elements from an unified interface. A well inventoried IT will boost failure resolution as well as facilitating skill sharing and transfer.</p></blockquote>
